# Inventory Forecasting & Risk Recommendation Hackathon Project

This project aims to forecast upcoming 3 months inventory levels at multiple warehouses and materials, predict inventory utilization risks (overflow, underflow, healthy), and recommend buy/sell actions based on weighted scoring combining shelf life, downgrade risk, stock value, forecasted movements, and cost impact. The results are visualized in an interactive Power BI dashboard.
